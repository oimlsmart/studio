/**
 * The packages-pin leg, the same invariant the www consumer runs in
 * its freshness sentinel (TODO.ia/03 carries it to every shell
 * consumer): a pinned npm package equals npm's latest release. The
 * site shell (@oimlsmart/site-shell) rode a vendored checkout
 * (file:vendor/site-shell) until TODO.public track 02 moved the site to
 * the exact published pin — the vendored channel existed so the shell's
 * default branch could run ahead of npm, and the pin flip closes that
 * gap: package.json must carry an EXACT version (no range, no file:),
 * and it must equal npm's latest published release. A red here means
 * the pin has fallen behind a real published release and should move
 * forward deliberately (a version bump review, then the release's
 * content lands here), or someone moved the dependency off the exact
 * pin, and both are this repo's rot to fix.
 *
 * The leg exits 0 when the pin is exact and current, and exits 1 with
 * the two versions printed otherwise.
